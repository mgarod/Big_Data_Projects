### Runtime Instructions
1. Navigate to path/Prog/Data and run 'python DataGenerators.py' (Optional)
2. Navigate to path/Prog and run 'python Main.py'

The program itself expects csv files present in path/Prog/Data folder with certain names (see below).

If using data not generated by the included generator, rename the files to those listed below.

### Databases
This project uses Cassandra and Neo4j. The program requires that an instance of each database is running locally before execution.

### CSV Files
If DataGenerators.py is run from the path/Prog/Data folder, then that folder will contain 6 csv files with the following headers listed below with some example data:

names.csv: User_id, first name, last name

orgs.csv: User_id, organization, organization type	

projects.csv: User_id, Project	

skills.csv: User_id, Skill,	Skill level	

interests.csv: User_id, Interest, Interest level
